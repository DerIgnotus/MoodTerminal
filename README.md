<b> Mood Terminal </b>

A Custom Terminal using C++ and SFML. 
Unfortunately I haven't added cmake or an executable yet, I will do that tho 

What Mood Terminal offers:
- fun little animations
- sounds
- background noise
- commands like: help, print, time, exit, moodlist, mood, asciiwave ...
- colors of the Terminal change depending on the mood

(If I updated things, like added cmake, and forgot to update the readme, pls do a pull request or issue or something so I know about it. Thanks! :))
